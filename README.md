💡 How It Works
Character Pool Creation:
Based on the user’s choices, the app creates a pool of characters from:

string.ascii_lowercase

string.ascii_uppercase

string.digits

string.punctuation

Random Selection:
A password is generated by randomly selecting characters from the combined pool.

Output:
The password is either printed (console) or displayed in a GUI with options to copy or regenerate.

# password_generator.py

import random
import string

def generate_password(length=12):
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))
    return password

print("Generated Password:", generate_password(16))

Example features:

Entry field to select length

Checkboxes to include/exclude character types

"Generate Password" button

"Copy" button to clipboard
